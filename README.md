Made Pong and the goal is to update and modify the code.
The code still has a flaw when it comes to ball movement and speed we are currently working on it.
Issues with getting the win screen to pop up.
We are currently in the testing stage of the game, so right now the winning score is the best of 3.


Enjoy this classic the AI does cheats sometimes
